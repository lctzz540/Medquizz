Quizz app for medical student
I am building this app to help students prepare for exams. It works by encoding the exam file (doc file) and the answer file (xlsx file) with the same file name. Then put the json data into react app. It's on the process of being finalized so many of my ideas haven't been implemented yet. It is not fully automated as a fullstack app but it basically meets your needs, I will update the most stable version continuously. And will try to finish it as soon as possible
Ussage
Put your exam file into exam-question folder, then run this command
'''console
python encode.py
'''
Then cd to final folder and start app
'''console
yarn start
'''
